# Hello! I'm Kaden Suderman.
I'm a Computer Vision and Embedded Systems Engineer with a knack for turning complex algorithms into real-world applications. I recently completed my Master's in Electronic & Computer Engineering from the University of Galway, where I achieved First Class Honors (which translates to a North American ~4.0 GPA).

## What I Do
I specialize in software development/engineering, applied AI & machine vision algorithms, embedded systems, and working with people to buid cool things. My skills include Python, Java, OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and testing the limits any single-board computers I can get my hands on.
