# Hello! I'm Kaden Suderman.
I'm a Computer Vision and Embedded Systems Engineer with a knack for turning complex algorithms into real-world applications. I recently completed my Master's in Electronic & Computer Engineering from the University of Galway, where I achieved First Class Honors (which translates to a North American ~4.0 GPA).

## What I Do
I specialize in software development/engineering, applied AI & machine vision algorithms, embedded systems, and working with people to buid cool things. My skills include Python, Java, OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and testing the limits any single-board computers I can get my hands on.

## Highlights
**My Master’s Thesis**: Tested the limits of Raspberry Pi with deep learning models—because when life gives you low latency, you make real-time object segmentation.

**Blink**: A random side-project to save my eye health 👀. Alerts the user according to the 20/20/20 rule- Look 20 meters for 20 sec every 20 min. 

## Fun Fact
When I'm not writing code or debugging my life, I'm probably strumming a guitar, traveling to a new country, or strapping my skis or surfboard to the top of a car 🏄
